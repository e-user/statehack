# statehack

statehack is a [Roguelike] homage to the [System Shock] series of games,
especially the original game.

statehack is under development and meant as a hobby project without any
guarantees of a stable release, ever.

## Copyright Information

statehack itself is distributed under the license below. Its sound and music
files are subject to other licenses and copyright holders as documented in the
separate statehack-sshock project.

The `System Shock` series and original materials are currently Copyright © Star
Insurance Company. This game is no official or licensed installment of the
series.

statehack uses libraries outside the core distribution of Clojure that are
subject to the Eclipse Public License. Therefore, distributing compiled versions
of the game is in violation of both the EPL and the GPLv3. I believe that the
EPL is a malicious license for the Free Software ecosystem as it is deliberately
incompatible with the GPL by restricting how people can use a program under its
license terms and should therefore not be used by anyone.  
If you are a copyright holder of one the dependencies, I urge you to relicense
your code under any GPL-compatible license, e.g. the GPL itself or the
non-copyleft, well-proven Apache-2 license.
